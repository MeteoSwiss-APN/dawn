/// Whenever a stencil writes to a variable and has and an other stencil has an  off-centered read
/// of the same variable afterwards, we need to do a halo exchange of the newly computed data
/// between these two stencils.
///
/// After this pass ran, the StencilDescAST will have boundary condition calls inserted at the
/// required spots such that whenever data needs to be transfered, Halo-Exchanges as well as
/// Boundary Conditions are triggered.
///
/// If a variable requires a boundary condition but no boundary conditon is specified, we issue an
/// assert during compilation
///
/// This pass should run after all the spltting is done: It depends on `PassStencilSplitter`
///
/// This pass is disabled until boundary conditions are redesigned.
